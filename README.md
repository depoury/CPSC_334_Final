# CPSC_334_Final
My CPSC 334 Final Project Code Repo

Please find 4 folders, each with its corresponding code within this repo.

Processing_UDP contains the .pde code and background for it that was used during the live showcase in Leeds.

RGB_Cathode contains arduino code for testing the RGB LEDs in the final product.

Speaker contains arduino code for testing the speaker in the final product.

WiFi_Enabled contains the final arduino code run on the ESP32 for the showcase and a manual override Python script that would grant me control of the lamp over WiFi in the event of failure elsewhere. (Fortunately, this went unused!)
